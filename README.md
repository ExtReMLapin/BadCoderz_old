# BadCoderz
Finding bad code easily


you can find a func_meta:src() func there :

http://oohh.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mmyy/lua/platforms/standard/meta/function.lua

Or make your own.

If you got the SVN access to metastruct, it's in "helpers" addon.

Fast way to scan for resource heavy .

This is NOT a profiler, it's not scanning for bad code performance, it's scanning for "easy to fix" optimizations problems.


TO DO :


-Scan for bad timers

-Include Decompiled Lua (i call it ASM even if it's not) scanning.

-Include open source func:src()

-Don't read commented parts/lines
