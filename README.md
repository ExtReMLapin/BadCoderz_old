# BadCoderz
Finding bad code easily



Fast way to scan for resource heavy .

This is NOT a profiler, it's not scanning for bad code performance, it's scanning for "easy to fix" optimizations problems.


TO DO :


-Scan for bad timers
-Include Decompiled Lua (i call it ASM even if it's not) scanning.
-Include open source func:src()
-Don't read commented parts/lines
